# About this repo:
Hello Friends!
All this project was created around one main question: **Why AtliQ has been growing so fast the last several months?**  
AtliQ Hardware is an international company that sells hardware products, and I wanted to see just the movement in LATAM, and how it has been growing in the last months.

- If you are interested to read the code, just go to ./src/notebooks and you will find the entire project organized in sequential notebooks from start to finish.  
- If you want to download and run it on your local machine, you will have to unzip the data folder. You don't want git to keep track your data files, right?
- And finally, if you want to understand the folder structure, just go to ./references. 
  
Get fun with all of these as me! n.n
